## Project Styles

We can build styles specific to a project using the `main.scss` files located in the `project-styles` folder, under the relevant project.
The associated command can be added to `gulpfile.js`.
This allows the addition of project specific overrides and keeps all style code in once place.
There is also a requirement for project specific paths baked into the generated css files.

For example, to build and copy styles into grantnav run:

```bash
npm run sass-grantnav
```

This will generated the compiled CSS and copy it to the [static assets](https://github.com/ThreeSixtyGiving/grantnav/tree/master/grantnav/frontend/static/css) folder in Grantnav.

If you wish to build the styles locally you can use:

```bash
npm run sass-grantnav-local
```
