## Project Styles

We can build styles specific to a project using the `main.scss` files located in the `project-styles` folder, under the relevant project.
The associated command can be added to `gulpfile.js`.
This allows the addition of project specific overrides and keeps all style code in once place.
There is also a requirement for project specific paths baked into the generated css files.

For example, to build styles for grantnav run:

```bash
npm run sass-grantnav
# or
npx gulp sass-grantnav
```
