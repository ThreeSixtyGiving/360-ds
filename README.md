## Project Styles

### Generating styles

The following describes how to generate the compiled CSS.
You can compile the CSS for any project in `src/project-styles/` by passing the project/folder name to the `compile-css` command using the `--project` parameter.
This will output the file to a folder at the root of this project. 

Alternatively, you can pass a path to the `--path` parameter which will output the compiled CSS file to an appropriate location.

```bash
# The following example will generate the CSS based on the Grantnav project and output it into the given path
# This is the correct path when 360-ds is loaded as a submodule at the root of the Grantnav codebase 
npm run compile-css -- --project 'grantnav' --path '../grantnav/frontend/static/css/'
```
