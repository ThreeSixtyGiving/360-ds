        <h2>Spreadsheet template</h2>
        <p>For convenience we provide a <a href="#">360Giving Spreadsheet Template</a> that can be used directly, or adapted to your needs.</p>
        <p>The template is a multi-sheet spreadsheet, and each sheet is described below.</p>
        <p>Many data producers will be able to fit all the information about a single grant on one row of a spreadsheet. In fact most data producers do exactly that, and provide a single sheet with many individual grants.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Where data producers have more complex information, for example where a grant has many beneficiary locations, we call this a One to many relationships. Information about how to create data with One to many relationships is described below.</li>
            <li>The 360Giving Spreadsheet template consists of a ‘grants’ sheet which contains the most common data fields.</li>
            <li>The Additional fields section provides details of all other possible fields that can be reported. (These are derived from the 360Giving JSON Schemas ).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Spreadsheet</h3>
        <p>Data placed in a spreadsheet can make use of easy to read, user-friendly column titles, and is ideal for recording one grant per row. This is the most common format that publishers choose. More complex representations of data can also be reported if required.</p>

        {% render '@table' %}

        <h4>json</h4>
        <p>Data in JSON format is ideal for direct use by developers building visualisations and web apps. The JSON should conform to the 360Giving JSON Schemas. Anyone automating the publication of their data from their internal databases or via an API may favour this format. The column titles used in spreadsheet representations of data are derived directly from the 360Giving JSON Schemas.</p>
