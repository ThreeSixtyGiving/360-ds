The top nav bar is meant to stay above all content. It doesn't need to be sticky or fixed, but can be if needed.

There is a helper variable which can be used to know the bar's height. `--top-nav-height.`

Each project might have a different max-width for the nav. There is a variable for that as well `--top-nav-max-width`.

The variation of the nav bar, item-highlighted, is used to highlight the current website. This is done by adding the class `threesixty-global-nav__wider-container` to the list item that should be highlighted.
