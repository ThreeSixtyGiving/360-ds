Visualise distinctions in grants published – on a scale from 0 to 1 to feed
into items' opacity – per year.

e.g. if the absolute scale should max out at £100k, you would pass:
* 1 (or higher) for data points with £100k+
* 0.5 for £50k
* 0 for no data

Pass in the same number of years for each data point which renders
this component, to keep the shading and widths comparable.
